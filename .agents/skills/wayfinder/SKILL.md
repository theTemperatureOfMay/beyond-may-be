description: Plan a multi-session effort as a shared map of decision tickets, applying issue-tracker and other external changes only after explicit user approval.
disable-model-invocation: true
---

A loose idea has arrived — too big for one agent session, and wrapped in fog: the way from here to the **destination** isn't visible yet. Wayfinding is about finding that way, not charging at the destination. This skill charts the way as a **shared map** on the repo's issue tracker, then works its **decision tickets** — questions whose resolution is a decision, not slices of a build to execute — one at a time until the route is clear.

The destination varies per effort, and naming it is the first act of charting — it shapes every ticket. It might be a spec to hand off and iterate on, a decision to lock before planning starts, or a change made in place like a data-structure migration. The map is domain-agnostic — engineering work, course content, whatever fits the shape.

## Plan, don't do

Wayfinder is **planning** by default: each ticket resolves a decision, and the map is done when the way is clear — nothing left to decide before someone goes and does the thing. The pull to just do the work is usually the signal you've reached the edge of the map and it's time to hand off. An effort can override this in its **Notes** — carrying execution into the map itself — but absent that, produce decisions, not deliverables.

## External-write gate

Reading and classifying tracker state, exploring local context, and drafting maps, tickets, comments,
labels, assignees, dependencies, and status changes require no approval. Do not mutate the issue
tracker, Git state, repository files, services, access, data, or any other external state until this
gate passes.

Before each write batch:

1. Re-read every target because another session may have changed it.
2. Show the final batch exactly: tracker, repository, or service; target issue or resource; title,
   body, or comment; labels; assignee; status; dependency edges; create, close, reopen, update, or
   delete actions; service action and affected data; expected impact; and recovery path.
3. Ask for explicit user approval for that exact batch immediately before applying it. Invoking
   wayfinder or approving a destination, decision, map, or earlier draft does not approve an
   unshown write.
4. Apply only the approved batch, verify the resulting state, and report it. If any target or
   content changes, stop, show the revised batch, and obtain fresh approval.

Without approval, return the draft and stop without changing external state. Git branch creation or
switching, commits, and repository-file changes also require the request and approval path in
`AGENTS.md`; tracker approval never grants them implicitly.

## Refer by name

Every map and ticket is an issue, so it has a **name** — its title. In everything the human reads — narration, the map's Decisions-so-far — refer to it by that name, never by a bare id, number, or slug. A wall of `#42, #43, #44` is illegible; names read at a glance. The id and URL don't vanish — a name wraps its link — but they ride *inside* the name, never stand in for it.

## The Map

The map is a single issue on this repo's issue tracker, labelled `wayfinder:map` — the canonical artifact. Its tickets are child issues of the map.

The map is an **index**, not a store. It lists the decisions made and points at the tickets that hold their detail; a decision lives in exactly one place — its ticket — so the map never restates it, only gists it and links.

**Where the map, its child tickets, blocking, and frontier queries physically live is tracker-specific.** The issue tracker should have been provided to you — run `/setup-skills` if not. Consult the tracker doc's "Wayfinding operations" section for how _this_ repo expresses them. If no tracker has been provided, default to the local-markdown tracker.

### The map body

The whole map at low resolution, loaded once per session. Open tickets are **not** listed — they are open child issues, found by query.

```markdown
## Destination

<what reaching the end of this map looks like — the spec, decision, or change this effort is finding its way to. One or two lines; every session orients to it before choosing a ticket.>

## Notes

<domain; skills every session should consult; standing preferences for this effort>

## Decisions so far

<!-- the index — one line per closed ticket: enough to judge relevance, then zoom the link for the detail the ticket holds -->

- [<closed ticket title>](link) — <one-line gist of the answer>

## Not yet specified

<!-- see "Fog of war": in-scope fog you can't ticket yet; graduates as the frontier advances -->

## Out of scope

<!-- see "Out of scope": work ruled beyond the destination; closed, never graduates -->
```

### Tickets

Each ticket is a **child issue** of the map; the tracker's issue id is its identity. Its body is the question, sized to one 100K token agent session:

```markdown
## Question

<the decision or investigation this ticket resolves>
```

Each ticket carries a `wayfinder:<type>` label — one of `research`, `prototype`, `grilling`, `task` (see [Ticket Types](#ticket-types)).

A session **claims** a ticket by assigning it to the dev driving the map so concurrent sessions skip
it. That assignee _is_ the claim: an open, unassigned ticket is unclaimed. Assignment is an external
write: preview the exact claim and pass the [External-write gate](#external-write-gate) before doing
ownership-dependent work. Re-check the frontier when applying the claim.

Blocking uses the tracker's **native** dependency relationship — essential because it renders the frontier _visually_ in the tracker's own UI, so the human sees what's takeable without opening the map. Only a tracker that lacks native blocking falls back to a body convention. A ticket is **unblocked** when every ticket blocking it is closed; the **frontier** is the open, unblocked, unclaimed children — the edge of the known.

The answer isn't part of the body — it's recorded on resolution (see [Work through the map](#work-through-the-map)). Assets created while resolving a ticket are linked from the issue, not pasted in.

## Ticket Types

Every ticket is either **HITL** — human in the loop, worked *with* a human who speaks for themselves — or **AFK**, driven by the agent alone. A HITL ticket only resolves through that live exchange; the agent never stands in for the human's side of it (a grilling agent that answers its own questions has broken this).

- **Research** (AFK): Reading documentation, third-party APIs, or local resources like knowledge bases to surface a fact a decision waits on. Resolved by a `/research` **subagent**. Use when knowledge outside the current working directory is required.
- **Prototype** (HITL): Raise the fidelity of the discussion by making the smallest cheap, rough, concrete artifact needed inside the ticket — an outline, a rough take, a stub, or throwaway UI/logic code. Link the artifact as an asset. Use when "how should it look" or "how should it behave" is the key question.
- **Grilling** (HITL): Conversation via `/grill` in its one-question route, with `/domain-modeling` when the map needs domain records. The default case.
- **Task** (HITL or AFK): Manual work that must happen before a *decision* can be made — nothing to decide, prototype, or research, but the discussion is blocked until it's done. Signing up for a service so its API can be judged, provisioning access, moving data so its shape can be seen. This is the one type that *does* rather than decides — and it earns its place by unblocking a decision, not by delivering the destination. The agent drives an AFK task only after its exact external actions pass the [External-write gate](#external-write-gate); otherwise it hands the human a precise checklist. Resolved when the work is done; the answer records what was done and non-sensitive facts (new URLs, row counts, or a reference to an approved secret store, never secret values) later tickets depend on.

## Fog of war

The map is _deliberately_ incomplete: don't chart what you can't yet see. Beyond the live tickets lies the **fog of war** — the dim view of decisions and investigations you can tell are coming but can't yet pin down, because they hang on questions still open. Resolving a ticket clears the fog ahead of it, graduating whatever's now specifiable into fresh tickets — one at a time, until the way to the destination is clear and no tickets remain.

The map's **Not yet specified** section is where that dim view is written down: the suspected question, the area to revisit later. It's the undiscovered frontier _toward_ the destination — everything here is in scope, just not sharp enough to ticket. Write as loosely or as fully as the view allows; it doubles as a signpost for collaborators reading where the effort is headed.

**Fog or ticket?** The test is whether you can state the question precisely now — _not_ whether you can answer it now.

- **Ticket when** the question is already sharp — even if it's blocked and you can't act on it yet.
- **Not yet specified when** you can't yet phrase it that sharply. Don't pre-slice the fog into ticket-sized pieces: it's coarser than a ticket, and one patch may graduate into several tickets, or none, once the frontier reaches it.

**Not yet specified** excludes what's already decided (Decisions so far), what's already a live ticket, and what's out of scope (the next section).

## Out of scope

Fog only ever gathers _toward_ the destination. The destination fixes the scope, so work beyond it is **out of scope** — it isn't fog, and it doesn't belong in **Not yet specified**. It gets its own **Out of scope** section on the map: work you've consciously ruled out of _this_ effort. Scope, not sharpness, lands it here.

Out-of-scope work never graduates — the frontier stops at the destination — so it returns only if the destination is redrawn, and then as a fresh effort, not a resumption.

Ruling something out of scope is a scoping act, not a step on the route. When a ticket that already exists turns out to sit past the destination — mis-scoped in while charting, or exposed by a resolution — propose closing it and adding one line to the **Out of scope** section: the gist plus why it's out of scope, linking the ticket. Apply both changes through the [External-write gate](#external-write-gate). It stays out of **Decisions so far**, which records the route actually walked — a scope boundary isn't a step on it.

## Invocation

Two modes. Either way, **never resolve more than one ticket per session** — with the exception of research tickets.

### Chart the map

User invokes with a loose idea.

1. **Name the destination.** Run `/grill` in its documentation route to pin down what this map is finding its way to — the spec, decision, or change. The destination fixes the scope, so it's settled first.
2. **Map the frontier.** Run `/grill` in its batch route, **breadth-first** this time: fan out across the whole space rather than deep on one thread, surfacing the open decisions and the first steps takeable now. **If this surfaces no fog** — the way to the destination is already clear, the whole journey small enough for one session — you don't need a map. Stop and ask the user how they'd like to proceed.
3. **Draft the map and current tickets.** Fill Destination and Notes, leave Decisions-so-far empty,
   sketch the fog in **Not yet specified**, and draft every child issue that is precise enough now.
   Draft the labels and blocking edges too; issues will be created before edges are wired.
4. **Preview the charting batch.** Re-read the tracker, show the exact map, tickets, labels, parent links,
   and dependency edges, then pass the [External-write gate](#external-write-gate).
5. **Apply and verify the approved batch.** Create the map and tickets, wire blocking edges in a
   second pass, and verify the resulting frontier. If approval is withheld, return the draft only.
6. Research may proceed read-only after charting. Do not create or switch a research branch, write a
   repository report, or publish findings to a ticket without the corresponding `AGENTS.md` request
   and approval. Resolving a research ticket uses the same resolution batch below.
7. Stop — charting is one session's work; it hand-resolves nothing.

### Work through the map

User invokes with a map (URL or number). A ticket is **optional** — without one, you pick the next decision, not the user.

1. Load the **map** — the low-res view, not every ticket body — and query the current frontier.
2. Choose the ticket. If the user named one, use it. Otherwise take the first frontier ticket in
   order. Show the exact assignee change, pass the [External-write gate](#external-write-gate), apply
   it, and verify the claim. Without claim approval, return the candidate and stop.
3. Resolve it — **zoom as needed**: fetch the full body of any related or closed ticket on demand;
   invoke the skills the `## Notes` block names. If in doubt, use `/grill` and choose its one-question
   or batch route.
4. Draft one resolution batch: the exact **resolution comment**, issue close, map
   Decisions-so-far pointer, newly surfaced tickets and dependency edges, fog changes, out-of-scope
   changes, and any ticket update or deletion made necessary by the decision.
5. Re-read every target, show the final batch, and pass the [External-write gate](#external-write-gate).
   Apply and verify only that approved batch. Without approval, return the resolution draft and leave
   the tracker unchanged apart from the separately approved claim.

The user may run unblocked tickets in parallel, so expect other sessions to be editing the tracker concurrently.
